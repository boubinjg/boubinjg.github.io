	   <div class="col-md-12">
		<p><font size="3">For my Senior Capstone at Miami University, I worked on a project for the Miami University library system. Scholarly Commons, a service run out of Miami University which indexes scholarly data and media generated by university scholars, assigned us to create a web app to store profile information for the scholars that generate this media. The Scholarly Commons team uses DSpace to store their data. Universities and other institutions across the world use DSpace for the storage, management, and dissemination of their open digital content. DSpace allows these institutions to host all types of media through online digital repositories. Many institutions use DSpace for hosting the scholarly work generated by their faculty and staff. While institutions can host scholarly work using DSpace, it may be useful to hold the biographical and contact information for the authors of such work, so interested students and potential collaborators may reach them. For our capstone project, we are creating a profile module for DSpace which will host personal and contact information for scholars who are associated a given DSpace instances institution. Our module works with DSpace's XMLUI user interface to post information such as scholars names, photos, research interests, social and professional networking information and more for interested parties to view. Our module allows for users to edit their profile, and indexes all profiles alphabetically for easy access.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3">We faced a number of challenges creating our profile module. DSpace uses a number of technologies that we were not familiar with. DSpace uses a number of apache products, (Tomcat, Ant, Maven, Cocoon), for managing large web applications. To modify the aspects we were familiar with (the Java backend, html/css/js front end, and relational database) we needed to learn and understand these tools. DSpace is also a fairly large application. It was originally published in the early 2000's and is on its 6th version. To create our profile module in such a way that it was completely integrated with DSpace, we had to understand DSpace's multi-layer theme and aspect system, and the capabilities DSpace already provides, as to not reinvent the wheel. DSpace's documentation leaves much to be desired. Most of DSpace's documentation is from version 1.1, and much more is nonexistent. To learn about the internals of DSpace, we had to do a lot of exploration. The unix grep command was employed liberally.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3">Eventually, we created a functional system to read in, store, and display scholar's profile data. Our app authenticates users with Miami's LDAP server, allows them to create and edit their page, link to academic and social media profiles, and displays their publications in the DSpace database using AJAX. Our project is currently being used by the Miami University library system and will soon be submitted to the open source community</font></p>

	<h3>Micro-language Compiler</h3>
	<h6><i>With John Crabill and Michelle Kojs</i></h6>
	<div class = "row">
	  <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
	    <p><font size="3">For the course <i> CSE 474 Compiler Design</i> at Miami University, we had a semester long group project in which we created our own compiler. We wrote a lexer, parser, and compiler to translate a user-defined microlanguage into a runnable assembly file. The compiler is written in Python and compiles into MIPS. The language includes primitives like integers, bools, and strings. The compiler has operators for concatenation, boolean operations, basic math, and printing. The compiler has control flow in the form of while loops and if statements which are nestable. The compiler also includes more advanced features such as functions, pointers, global variables with static scoping, and recursion support.</p>
	     <p>The language takes some syntactic influences from Pascal and C. In the example program you can see the "begin" and "end" tokens as one would see in Pascal, as well as the pascal assignment operator ":=". Like C, the language requires a main function which can be void. Variables specified by the dereference "~" operator are pointers. You can also take the address "&" of a variable. This simple program demonstrates some of the functionalities of the language like pointer operations, I/O, control flow, and arithmetic. Many of the featuers are implemented in a way that may look verbose. Function calls such as "func foo2(&c) funed" on line 24 seem to have more tokens than necessary. These extra tokens are added to keep the language LL1.</p>
	     <p>This was by far the most difficult project I ever worked on for an undergraduate course. The project took place over the entire semester, slowly building on the foundations we had laid in our previous submissions. On my github, the project is divided into sections. Each section has a new compiler with more features than the last. Part 8 incorporates all of the features described above. You can check this project out on github <a href="https://github.com/boubinjg/CSE474CompilersProject">here</a>.<font></p>

	<h3>AI Game Project</h3>
	<h6><i>With Tyler Moore</i></h6> 
        <div class = "row">
	  <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
		<p><font size="3">For the course <i>CSE 486 Artificial Intelligence</i> at Miami University, we were required to create AI bots to play a board game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domineering">Domineering</a>. We created a bot which uses known optimal plays and more advanced AI techniques to beat human players and other bots. The cornerstone of any basic AI game bot for a board game as simple as domineering is alpha-beta pruning. Our bot uses alpha-beta pruning as a last resort. Time is a consideration, so our bot prefers validated options which take less time to calculate. To provide these validated options, we used preprocessing.</p>
	
		<p>First, our bot uses an opening book. Domineering has a series of known best openings. Placing a tile one row above or one column next to (depending on your player color) any corner will net you the best possible move for that round. This made it easy for us to determine the moves made by our bot for the first two rounds of the game. We simply check for an unoccupied corner and take the first one we find. After this, our bot needed to use some sort of evaluation function so score moves. Alpha-beta returns the highest value move out of the move tree it creates. To score a move, you need an evaluation function. Our evaluation function scores based on two things: possible moves and guaranteed moves. By the nature of domineering, for a given board there are some squares which either player can access, and some which only one player can access. We call these possible moves and guaranteed moves respectively. Our evaluation function scores a board on these criteria, adding one point for a possible move for our player, and two points for a guaranteed move for our player. Conversely, we subtract one point for a possible move for our opponent, and two points for a guaranteed move.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3">As stated above, alpha-beta with this scoring system is used as a last resort. The specifications of our project allowed for 500MB of storage for our bot to use. We decided to take advantage of this space and preprocess game moves for common strategies. Using alpha-beta with this evaluation function, we played our bot against a number of bots using common strategies, such as greedy evaluation, alpha-beta with low depth, random evaluation, and others. Using this strategy we were able to preprocess tens of thousands of common early-game moves, which takes the pressure off of alpha-beta, allowing it spend processing time during late game.</p>
	
		<p>This project was a really great way to teach students about the basics of Artificial intelligence using an interesting topic and hands on learning. Our bot didn't win any competitions, but it performed well. We initially tried to implement transposition tables, a very dominant strategy that would have increased performance dramatically, but we weren't able to complete that feature in the allotted time, so we fell back onto our preprocessing feature. I'm still proud of what we created, and of how much I learned in this course.

	<h3>MEGA Tournament Scheduler</h3>
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="col-md-12">
	    <p><font size="3">The Miami Electronic Gaming Association (Miami University's videogame club) runs a tournament every year called the "Gaming Gauntlet" which is a team based competition consisting of a number of videogame related challenges. The first round of this tournament poses a significant scheduling challenge. There are three games for teams to play. Each team must play every game, ideally against a unique opponent, and only once. After every team has played each game, their scores (number of wins and losses) are calculated, and the top teams move to the next round. This format poses a problem for anyone attempting to schedule it. Firstly, the club doesn't know how many teams will show up ahead of time. Without any prep-time, scheduling must be done on the fly. Secondly, this problem is harder to solve than it looks. To the uninitiated, this may sound slightly like round robin scheduling; however, the scheduling parameters for this tournament can not hold if there is an uneven number of teams, or if there are less than 6 teams. Even given these constraints, the algorithm still took me a little time to figure out.</p>

	    <p>I was inspired to write this program after witnessing the chaos which erupted from a gaming gauntlet event with an odd number of teams. I am happy to say that this year's gaming gauntlet, which utilized my algorithm, went much smoother. The algorithm was implemented in Visual Basic as an Excel VBA. I wanted to make this application something that was portable, easy to understand, and user friendly. Using Excel wouldn't have been my first choice, but it doesn't require the user to have any knowledge of computer science to run this simple program. Also, most people have Excel or have access to it, and Excel's interface is great for representing tables.
