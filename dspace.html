                <p><font size="3">For my Senior Capstone at Miami University, I worked on a project for the Miami University library system. Scholarly Commons, a service run out of Miami University which indexes scholarly data and media generated by university scholars, assigned us to create a web app to store profile information for the scholars that generate this media. The Scholarly Commons team uses DSpace to store their data. Universities and other institutions across the world use DSpace for the storage, management, and dissemination of their open digital content. DSpace allows these institutions to host all types of media through online digital repositories. Many institutions use DSpace for hosting the scholarly work generated by their faculty and staff. While institutions can host scholarly work using DSpace, it may be useful to hold the biographical and contact information for the authors of such work, so interested students and potential collaborators may reach them. For our capstone project, we are creating a profile module for DSpace which will host personal and contact information for scholars who are associated a given DSpace instances institution. Our module works with DSpace's XMLUI user interface to post information such as scholars names, photos, research interests, social and professional networking information and more for interested parties to view. Our module allows for users to edit their profile, and indexes all profiles alphabetically for easy access.</font></p>

                <p><font size="3">We faced a number of challenges creating our profile module. DSpace uses a number of technologies that we were not familiar with. DSpace uses a number of apache products, (Tomcat, Ant, Maven, Cocoon), for managing large web applications. To modify the aspects we were familiar with (the Java backend, html/css/js front end, and relational database) we needed to learn and understand these tools. DSpace is also a fairly large application. It was originally published in the early 2000's and is on its 6th version. To create our profile module in such a way that it was completely integrated with DSpace, we had to understand DSpace's multi-layer theme and aspect system, and the capabilities DSpace already provides, as to not reinvent the wheel. DSpace's documentation leaves much to be desired. Most of DSpace's documentation is from version 1.1, and much more is nonexistent. To learn about the internals of DSpace, we had to do a lot of exploration. The unix grep command was employed liberally.</font></p>

                <p><font size="3">Eventually, we created a functional system to read in, store, and display scholar's profile data. Our app authenticates users with Miami's LDAP server, allows them to create and edit their page, link to academic and social media profiles, and displays their publications in the DSpace database using AJAX. Our project is currently being used by the Miami University library system and will soon be submitted to the open source community</font></p>
