	  <h3>Trust Calibration in Human-Automation Teams</h3>

		<p><font size="3">At AFIT, I conducted experimental research on trust calibration in human-automation teams. Trust is the cornerstone of all human relationships. Relationships with advanced automated agents are similar. To ensure optimal performance, human users must appropriately trust automation. An operator who is too trusting of automation may allow automation errors to go uncorrected, while an operator who trusts the agent too little will not receive maximum benefit from the aid of an automated agent. We sought to understand the mechanisms necessary to classify humans as calibrated or uncalibrated.</font></p>

 	      <p><font size="3">Calibration is the relationship between the human perception of an automated agent's ability and its actual ability. Calibrated users will be able to, through experience or instinct, identify and work with automated agents in a capacity relative to their ability. Our goal of this project is to create a model to classify calibrated users and uncalibrated users with a particular system. By classifying calibrated and undercalibrated users in larger systems, it may be possible to augment automation strategies to fit users calibration profiles. To perform calibration experiments, we used an environment called Space Navigator</font></p>
	   	
        	<p><font size="3">Space Navigator is an air-traffic control style game specifically designed to evaluate the effectiveness of human-automation teams. It includes multiple types of automated agents, the ability to capture and time events, and the ability to impose easily distinguishable taskload levels, allowing researchers to easily study human-automation team dynamics and evaluate theoretical models in an experimental environment. Space Navigator has been developed at AFIT for years by a number of researchers. It was developed in Unity using C#. While at AFIT, I modified Space Navigator for use in a participant study in combination with The Ohio State University, used for multiple independent research projects, including our calibration study. My modifications to the game included data management and reporting fixes, interface changes, and the addition of psychological measures, such as an Implicit Association Test and subjective trust questionnaires. The data gathered from this study was used in the masters thesis of Lt. Anthony Hillesheim at AFIT and the PhD Dissertation of Lorraine Borghetti at OSU as well as other scholarly work</font></p>
		
		<p><font size="3">Using data from the participant study, we created a model for classifying participants by calibration which incorporates compliance and performance data from a few hours of gameplay. We used the results of our model and more data points to train a random-forest machine learning algorithm to classify participants as calibrated, undercalibrated, or overcalibrated using only 4 minutes worth of gameplay. Preliminary results show that the random forest algorithm has a 98% success rate in classifying participants with 4 minutes of data as compared to the classification model using multiple hours of gameplay data.</font></p>

	  <h3>Quantifying and Influencing Trust in Human-Automation Teams</h3>

		<p>At AFIT in 2015, I began researching human-automation teaming. Human-automation teaming is becoming a common strategy for handling complex tasks. Automation is used heavily in transportation, manufacturing, energy production, and military applications. While the use of these automated systems generally results in greater performance than humans performing alone, humans are reluctant to adopt these superior systems due to lack of trust. Anecdotally, I myself find it difficult to trust systems which I do not fully understand, even if I witness their superior performance. At AFIT, we investigated the components of trust when dealing with automated systems in order isolate the components of trust, study the effects of trust, and to influence the rate of adoption of new technologies.</p>

	        <p>We studied the compliance and reliance, two behavioral measures of human trust, using data obtained by a participant study run by Maj. Jason Bindewald, PhD, using Space Navigator. Using this data, we developed a framework for quantifying compliance and reliance over user taskload. Using this model, we created a validated discrete event simulation in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMPRINT_(Improved_Performance_Research_Integration_Tool)>IMPRINT</a>, demonstrating that our model correctly replicates the effects of human trust of automated systems.</p>
	      
		<p>We continued to analyze the data, looking for a general model for reliance and compliance in relation to automated systems. The system level model we created relates trust behaviors to objective variables, like automation reliability, performance, and user taskload, and also to subjective variables, such as user trust, acceptance, stress, and automation predictability</p>

	  <h3>Cognitive Workload Modeling of Cyber Operators</h3>
	  <h6><i>With Dr. Brett Borghetti, Greg Dye, and Maj. Christina Rusnock</i></h6>
	    <div class="col-md-12">
		<p><font size="3">When I first started working at AFIT in 2014, I applied cognitive workload modeling research to the cyber security domain. We analyzed the function of the intrusion detection and reporting systems used by Air Force cyber security operators to find high workload components. Workload, a measure of the total mental effort required to perform a task, can be used to streamline large scale systems. In critical systems, like cyber operations, small changes in parts of the process can drastically decrease workload and increase operator attentiveness and performance.</p>
		<div class="row">
		  <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
		  <p>To model workload, we used IMPRINT, a discrete event simulation and human performance modeling tool. We created a simulation of the intrusion detection process based on descriptions of the process by a subject matter expert. We analyzed the workload results, learning that the system included extremely variable workload, where operators went from high workload to low workload tasks very often. Operators also undergo long periods of constant vigilance. Using this current system, operators must be constantly watching their monitors, like a driver watching for deer on a dark country road. This research has been used by others at AFIT to improve interface design for military cyber operations intrusion detection systems.</p> 
		  <p>After determining the workload related to the high-vigilance task, we decided to create a framework for modeling fatigue related to vigilance tasks. High workload situations are known to cause increased operator fatigue. If operators are experiencing high workload for long periods of time, they will begin to feel the effects of vigilance decrement and fatigue. The IMPRINT community did not have a framework for handling vigilance decrement, so we set out to find a framework of our own. Initially, used we a sustained attention equation found by researchers in the late 1980s which related well to our domain. Eventually we settled on modeling the Psychomotor Vigilance Task, a test used to measure vigilance decrement in times of sleep deprivation. By creating a model instead of using an equation, we created a more general, adaptable, and understandable framework for modeling vigilance decrement and fatigue.</font></p>

	  <h3>Dynamic Process Migration in Agent Based Simulation</h3>
	  <h6><i>With Dr. Dhananjai Rao, and Paul Bondurant</i></h6>
	    <div class="row">
		  <div class ="col-lg-8 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
		  <p><font size="3">As a freshman at Miami in 2013, I worked with Dr. Dhananjai Rao and Paul Bondurant on dynamic process migration in agent based simulation. Agent based simulations track interactions between independent agents interacting in an environment. As with all simulations, all interactions are dependent on the clock. For the simulation to yield proper results, all interacting agents must be on the same clock time. This is not usually an issue in serial agent based simulations. In parallel agent based simulations, agents in one process may be at a different clock time than agents in another process. Even if the two processes started at the same time, minute hardware differences, discrepancies in required processing, and the random nature of simulations can all cause clocks between processes to be out of sync.</p>
		  <p>The time-warp algorithm fixes this issue. If two agents on different clock times interact, time is turned back for the agent furthest in the future. The issue with this algorithm is that it is very time consuming to run. When an agent rewinds, all of its interactions must be redone, which can take considerable processing time. The goal of this research, Paul Bondurant's Masters thesis, was to limit the the number of interactions by keeping groups of agents who interacted often on the same clock time. Using a multi-node compute cluster, Paul devised an algorithm to move commonly communicating processes to similar nodes, to cut down on time warps.</font></p>
