            <p><font size="3">The Miami Electronic Gaming Association (Miami University's videogame club) runs a tournament every year called the "Gaming Gauntlet" which is a team based competition consisting of a number of videogame related challenges. The first round of this tournament poses a significant scheduling challenge. There are three games for teams to play. Each team must play every game, ideally against a unique opponent, and only once. After every team has played each game, their scores (number of wins and losses) are calculated, and the top teams move to the next round. This format poses a problem for anyone attempting to schedule it. Firstly, the club doesn't know how many teams will show up ahead of time. Without any prep-time, scheduling must be done on the fly. Secondly, this problem is harder to solve than it looks. To the uninitiated, this may sound slightly like round robin scheduling; however, the scheduling parameters for this tournament can not hold if there is an uneven number of teams, or if there are less than 6 teams. Even given these constraints, the algorithm still took me a little time to figure out.</p>

            <p>I was inspired to write this program after witnessing the chaos which erupted from a gaming gauntlet event with an odd number of teams. I am happy to say that this year's gaming gauntlet, which utilized my algorithm, went much smoother. The algorithm was implemented in Visual Basic as an Excel VBA. I wanted to make this application something that was portable, easy to understand, and user friendly. Using Excel wouldn't have been my first choice, but it doesn't require the user to have any knowledge of computer science to run this simple program. Also, most people have Excel or have access to it, and Excel's interface is great for representing tables.
